# Changelog

All notable changes to Mardas MD2PDF are tracked here.

The project follows semantic versioning for user-visible behavior. Patch releases may include documentation, generated guide PDF refreshes, regression tests, and narrowly scoped renderer/Studio fixes.

## 1.17.0 - 2026-07-10

### Added
- Added an offline-first bibliography and citation engine for local BibTeX and CSL JSON sources in single-file and multi-file Book Mode output.
- Added parenthetical and narrative citation syntax, built-in `author-date` and `numeric` styles, localized Persian/English punctuation and digits, stable PDF bibliography destinations, citation back-links, and optional uncited entries.
- Added `[bibliography]` project configuration, equivalent front-matter fields, and CLI overrides for sources, style, title, enablement, and uncited-entry behavior.

### Changed
- Resolved Book Mode citations only after all chapters are assembled so one first-use order and one bibliography are shared across the complete book.
- Extended clean-wheel release verification to render citations from an installed package and verify bibliography destinations in the generated PDF.
- Added deterministic same-author/same-year disambiguation with `a`, `b`, ... suffixes in both citations and bibliography entries.

### Security
- Kept bibliography processing local and offline, constrained configured sources to the document or project root, bounded source count, source size, and entry count, and protected source files from PDF/debug-output collisions.
- Rejected malformed sources, repeated source paths, duplicate bibliography keys, undefined citation keys, and malformed citation groups before Chromium starts.

### Tests
- Added BibTeX, CSL JSON, Unicode/LaTeX normalization, macro, author-date, numeric, localization, cross-chapter, path-boundary, size-limit, entry-limit, diagnostics, clean-wheel, and PDF destination regression coverage.

## 1.16.0 - 2026-07-10

### Added
- Added an opt-in semantic cross-reference engine for labeled figures, tables, display equations, and code listings in both single-file and multi-file Book Mode output.
- Added continuous global numbering and chapter-scoped numbering, localized English/Persian captions and references, stable PDF destinations, and generated lists of figures, tables, equations, and listings.
- Added `--references`, `--numbering-scope`, and paired list-generation CLI overrides plus matching versioned `[references]` project configuration and front-matter fields.

### Changed
- Resolved Book Mode labels only after all chapters are assembled so references can target objects in another listed chapter while retaining deterministic manifest order and chapter namespaces.
- Extended the clean-wheel release gate to build a labeled multi-chapter book and verify all four numbered object kinds and their PDF named destinations.

### Fixed
- Recalculated caption direction/profile classes after semantic label markers are removed, preserving Persian and mixed-script caption typography.
- Kept reference tokens inside code, links, scripts, styles, and literal contexts unchanged and avoided bidi isolation before semantic reference resolution.

### Security
- Kept reference labels document-internal and independent of local-file or URL resolution; labels cannot expand filesystem access, enable scripts, or bypass safe-HTML and asset policies.
- Failed before Chromium on duplicate labels, unresolved references, kind mismatches, malformed labels, and ambiguous markers.

### Tests
- Added single-file and Book Mode regression coverage for all object kinds, localized numbering, punctuation boundaries, cross-chapter resolution, duplicate/unresolved diagnostics, raw HTML handling, generated lists, CLI/config precedence, and clean-wheel PDF destinations.

## 1.15.0 - 2026-07-10

### Added
- Added deterministic multi-file Book Mode driven by the ordered `[book].chapters` manifest in `mardas.toml`, with `init --book`, `validate-book`, `explain-book`, and `build-book` workflows.
- Added one-pass book assembly with project-level cover/output settings, per-chapter Markdown/front matter, global TOC and PDF outline generation, chapter title overrides, optional inter-chapter page breaks, and atomic debug-HTML/PDF output.
- Added safe shared project-root asset resolution and internal links between listed chapters, including optional heading fragments.

### Changed
- Namespaced chapter heading, anchor, and footnote IDs before assembly so repeated titles and local identifiers remain unambiguous across the complete book.
- Extended the clean-wheel release gate to create, validate, explain, and render a starter two-chapter book from the installed console entry point.
- Refactored the PDF pipeline to accept an already parsed `MarkdownRenderResult`, allowing single-file and Book Mode output to share the same cover, Chromium, metadata, outline, page-label, and atomic-write implementation.

### Security
- Restricted chapter sources and shared assets to the project root after symlink resolution, rejected absolute or duplicate chapter paths and source/output collisions, and kept unrelated local filesystem links inert.
- Limited Book Mode manifests to 512 ordered chapters and supported Markdown extensions before rendering begins.

### Tests
- Added Book Mode regression coverage for manifest ordering, chapter containment, duplicate sources, ID namespacing, title overrides, shared assets, cross-chapter links, page breaks, output collisions, JSON diagnostics, starter-project generation, and clean-wheel release execution.

## 1.14.0 - 2026-07-10

### Added
- Added versioned `mardas.toml` project configuration with nearest-ancestor discovery, explicit `--config` selection, `--no-config` opt-out, schema validation, safe relative-path resolution, and deterministic CLI override precedence.
- Added `mrs-md2pdf init`, `validate`, `doctor`, and `explain-config` workflows with stable text/JSON diagnostics for automation and local environment inspection.
- Added diagnostic coverage for malformed TOML/YAML, unknown or invalid configuration values, missing configured assets, blocked local/remote images, heading hierarchy jumps, risky security settings, missing dependencies, Chromium discovery, and packaged MathJax integrity.

### Changed
- Added paired CLI overrides such as `--no-toc`, `--cover`, `--header-footer`, `--mathjax`, `--safe-html`, and `--block-remote-assets` so command-line automation can override either side of a project boolean.
- Extended the clean-wheel release gate to initialize, validate, inspect, and diagnose a real project using only installed console entry points.
- Added the Python 3.10 `tomli` compatibility dependency while using the standard-library `tomllib` on Python 3.11 and newer.

### Fixed
- Resolved appearance consistently as `CLI > mardas.toml > front matter > built-in defaults`, including syntax highlighting, document CSS, footer styling, and Chromium PDF output.
- Corrected clean-wheel release verification to check the stylesheet and branding asset names that are actually shipped in the package.
- Restored front-matter appearance behavior when no CLI or project override is supplied instead of silently forcing CLI parser defaults.

### Security
- Warned explicitly when project configuration enables unsanitized HTML or remote network assets and documented command-line safety overrides.
- Rejected oversized project files, unknown schema sections/keys, unsupported schema versions, invalid values, and invalid configured paths before Chromium starts.

### Tests
- Added project-configuration, precedence, path-resolution, structured-diagnostic, project-command, clean-release, and front-matter appearance regression coverage.

## 1.13.40 - 2026-07-10

### Security
- Restricted Markdown, safe-HTML, and front-matter branding assets to supported regular images inside the document root, including symlink containment, MIME validation, and size limits.
- Made Studio Fast Preview block remote/local image fetches and unsafe or filesystem link schemes while keeping PDF-like Preview as the authoritative renderer-backed path.
- Added bounded YAML depth, node-count, scalar-size, and cycle validation; bounded Studio export concurrency; and isolated stale-preview coordination per browser tab.

### Changed
- Converted A0-A6, B0-B6, Letter, Legal, Tabloid, and Ledger formats to explicit Chromium dimensions and bounded custom page dimensions to 10-5000 mm per side.
- Made Python wheel and source-distribution builds deterministic and connected the tagged-release workflow to the consolidated release gate.
- Added IPv6 loopback Studio support and kept duplicate asset basenames in separate directories without ambiguous root-level fallback aliases.

### Fixed
- Prevented PDF output or debug HTML from overwriting the Markdown source through direct, relative, symlink, hardlink, or case-normalized path aliases.
- Wrote final PDF and debug HTML artifacts atomically so a failed post-processing/write step preserves the previous valid output.
- Rejected malformed or recursive front matter with actionable diagnostics, accepted UTF-8 BOM input, and preserved math/footnote-like text inside indented code and multiline code spans.
- Deduplicated manual and generated heading IDs, blocked machine-local `file:` PDF annotations, and converted common CLI failures to concise messages without default tracebacks.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for local-file disclosure, output-path aliases, atomic-write failures, Fast Preview URL policy, bounded YAML, Studio concurrency/tab isolation, page dimensions, deterministic distributions, IPv6, BOM input, code-literal preservation, and controlled CLI diagnostics.

## 1.13.39 - 2026-07-10

### Security
- Enforced required, non-negative, bounded `Content-Length` values, rejected unsupported `Transfer-Encoding`, and added deadlines plus exact-length checks for Studio request-body reads.
- Prevented Studio renderer exceptions, temporary paths, and operating-system details from being returned to API clients while retaining full local error logs.

### Fixed
- Rejected normalized, case-insensitive, ancestor/descendant, and basename-fallback collisions between attached Studio assets before writing any temporary files.
- Protected Studio working files such as `document.md` and the requested PDF output path from attached-asset overwrite collisions.

### Tests
- Added HTTP-level regression coverage for negative request lengths, unsupported transfer encodings, controlled renderer failures, conflicting asset paths, reserved paths, and partial-write prevention.

## 1.13.38 - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- Polished Studio UI/UX for final-workflow maturity with clearer Preview status pills, less-clipped header controls, and non-blocking toast feedback for high-signal actions.
- Improved command palette keyboard navigation with active-item tracking, Arrow/Home/End movement, and `aria-selected` state.

### Fixed
- Prevented the Preview status badge from visually clipping short status labels in narrow preview panes.
- Replaced the confusing first-run restore failure message with a neutral local-state reset status.

## 1.13.37 - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- Limited Studio editor-to-preview scroll synchronization to Fast preview only, because PDF-like preview includes renderer-only cover, TOC, and page geometry that cannot stay ratio-synchronized with the Markdown source pane.
- Tuned PDF-like preview scrollbars so dark PDF previews inside the dark Studio interface no longer show a bright native scrollbar.

### Fixed
- Reworked Markdown editor line numbers into explicit virtualized rows with physical-line wrapping disabled, padding-aware scroll calculations, and resize-aware gutter refreshes for long documents.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for Fast-only scroll synchronization, hardened long-document line-number gutter behavior, PDF-like preview scrollbar styling, and updated Studio browser audit checks.

## 1.13.36 - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- Kept Studio PDF-like preview responsive on very large drafts by pausing automatic renderer-backed refreshes above the large-document threshold and exposing an explicit manual refresh action.
- Made local auto-save messaging more explicit when a draft is too large to persist in browser storage.

### Fixed
- Allowed empty Studio drafts to render as a blank PDF-like preview instead of surfacing a backend error while keeping PDF export validation strict.
- Made Studio static GET routing ignore query strings so cache-busted `/index.html?...` and asset requests resolve correctly.
- Bounded generated Studio filenames and asset path segments with hash suffixes while preserving file extensions.
- Emitted UTF-8-safe `Content-Disposition` filenames for Studio PDF downloads so non-ASCII filenames do not break HTTP headers.
- Added a large debug-HTML export confirmation and retained delayed object-URL cleanup for browser download stability.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for empty draft previews, query-string GET routing, filename/path length bounds, UTF-8-safe attachment headers, and large-document Studio preview safeguards.

## 1.13.35 - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- Improved developer and release workflow reliability by letting `python -m pytest` find the `src/` package directly from a checkout and by documenting the full-source distribution intent.
- Made the full visual QA matrix more resumable and observable by skipping already completed child chunks, writing active-chunk heartbeat data, and preserving elapsed-time metadata in the matrix summary.
- Clarified Studio Fast preview as an approximate, browser-local editing preview while keeping PDF-like preview as the renderer-backed fidelity path.

### Fixed
- Hardened Studio project-bundle loading so oversized, duplicate, malformed, or unsafe embedded assets are skipped before they enter browser state, with a clear skipped-asset warning.
- Delayed browser object-URL revocation for Studio downloads to avoid download races in stricter browsers.
- Warned when Markdown is too large for local auto-save instead of implying that the full draft was saved locally.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for checkout-local pytest configuration, source-distribution manifest policy, visual-QA resumability/heartbeat controls, Fast-preview wording, and Studio project-bundle asset validation.

## 1.13.34 - 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- Made the Studio direction toggle update the real document direction option and rerender PDF-like preview, so the visible renderer-backed preview matches the exported RTL/LTR setting instead of only flipping the legacy fast-preview container.
- Rebuilt the Studio “Copy CLI command” workflow around POSIX shell quoting so filenames, metadata, brand labels, watermarks, spaces, quotes, and Persian text produce a safer command line.
- Added latest-only request coordination for renderer-backed Studio previews so stale PDF-like preview requests return `stale_preview` instead of updating the UI after newer edits.

### Documentation
- Clarified Studio Mermaid wording so the fast browser preview is described as an approximate flowchart preview while exported PDFs continue to use the offline Mermaid flowchart renderer subset.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for Studio direction/export synchronization, CLI command quoting, and latest-only backend preview request handling.

## 1.13.33 - 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- Hardened Studio render endpoints so `/api/render` and `/api/render-html` require same-origin requests, trusted local Host headers, `Content-Type: application/json`, and a per-session Studio API token.
- Added `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to Studio text, JSON, asset, and PDF responses to reduce browser content-type ambiguity.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for Studio API Host, Origin, Fetch Metadata, media-type, and token rejection paths, including an HTTP-level cross-origin POST check.

## 1.13.32 - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- Removed the experimental automatic page-boundary guides from Studio PDF-like preview because screen-side DOM height simulation could not reliably match Chromium's print/PDF pagination across covers, TOCs, tables, images, code blocks, and font loading.
- Kept the lighter PDF-like preview as a renderer-backed page-sized sheet with margins, auto-fit scaling, and explicit Markdown page-break indicators only.

### Tests
- Updated Studio GUI regression and browser visual-audit checks to verify the PDF-like preview CSS is injected while deprecated page-guide overlays are absent.

## 1.13.31 - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- Reworked Studio PDF-like page indicators from intrusive center-page boundary overlays to non-intrusive page guides that stay in the page margins and no longer cover document content.
- Reduced Studio editing overhead by caching Markdown line counts, virtualizing gutter updates through animation frames, throttling editor-to-preview scroll synchronization, and replacing split-based word/line counting with allocation-light counters.
- Added cancellation and request-key caching for renderer-backed PDF-like preview refreshes so stale preview requests do not update the UI and repeated unchanged renders are skipped.

### Tests
- Updated Studio GUI regression and browser visual-audit checks for the margin-based PDF-like page guides and long-document editor behavior.

## 1.13.30 - 2026-07-03

### Changed
- Removed the Studio Exact PDF preview mode because the renderer-backed PDF-like preview provides the useful workflow with far less latency and fewer browser-viewer failure modes.
- Added visible page-boundary markers to the Studio PDF-like preview so users can see where one simulated PDF page ends and the next page starts while editing.
- Virtualized Markdown editor line numbers so long documents continue numbering correctly beyond several thousand lines without rendering a huge line-number text node.
- Synchronized editor scroll with the renderer-backed preview iframe when PDF-like preview is active.

### Tests
- Expanded Studio visual audit checks to verify PDF-like page markers and long-editor line numbering through a browser session.
- Updated GUI regression tests for the two-mode preview model and the paged PDF-like preview CSS/JavaScript.

## 1.13.29 - 2026-06-29

### Changed
- Made Studio default to a renderer-backed PDF-like preview that injects screen-only page sizing, margins, auto-fit scaling, paper shadow, and visible page-break markers so the preview is closer to exported PDF geometry.
- Added an optional Exact PDF preview mode that renders the current document through the existing PDF endpoint and displays the result in the browser PDF viewer for highest-fidelity manual checks.
- Refreshed Studio preview automatically when export options or attached assets change, instead of waiting for the next Markdown edit.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for Studio preview page dimensions, injected preview CSS and scaling script, exact-PDF preview wiring, option/asset-triggered preview refreshes, and the live Studio visual-audit preview path.

## 1.13.28 - 2026-06-29

### Fixed
- Prevented multi-digit numbered-code gutters from wrapping one digit per visual row in print/PDF output, especially for `linenostart` values above 9 in dark academic/textbook visual QA cases.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for numbered-code gutter CSS so print wrapping rules cannot reapply to line-number cells.
- Verified the final visual QA matrix across all 56 style/palette/mode combinations for both appearance and feature-heavy samples, plus the Studio browser screenshot audit.

## 1.13.27 - 2026-06-29

### Fixed
- Blocked remote Markdown images in the direct `render_markdown` API by default, matching the file-based renderer and CLI privacy boundary while still honoring `allow_remote_images=True`.
- Preserved Studio attached asset paths with spaces and Unicode characters so Markdown image references and custom brand logos resolve to the uploaded browser asset names instead of dash-renamed sanitized paths.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for direct remote-image blocking, direct remote-image opt-in, and Studio attached assets with whitespace/Unicode path segments.

## 1.13.26 - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- Changed Markdown footnote rendering from a single document-end endnote section to page-local print footnote blocks inserted near the reference, avoiding guide footnote calls that jump to the final page of the PDF.
- Updated the official English and Persian guide footnote samples so the Persian/RTL smoke sample and the dedicated Footnotes section use distinct footnote IDs and demonstrate local footnote placement.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for page-local footnote sections, repeated-reference local clones, localized Persian footnote markers, and footnote print CSS.

## 1.13.25 - 2026-06-21

### Documentation
- Removed the standalone feature/reference docs for appearance, branding, Markdown fidelity, PDF navigation, PDF typography, Persian/RTL, Studio, and visual QA because their user-facing content now belongs in the English and Persian guides.
- Polished the guide-first documentation wording in the README, docs index, documentation policy, and both guides so the guides are explicitly the complete feature manual and live renderer sample.

### Tests
- Updated documentation integrity tests to reject stale feature-reference links and confirm the guides cover the retired feature areas.

## 1.13.24 - 2026-06-21

### Documentation
- Reorganized the documentation architecture around a guide-first model: the English and Persian guides are now explicitly the canonical user manuals and live renderer samples, while focused docs are maintainer contracts instead of parallel tutorials.
- Rewrote the feature-reference docs for appearance, branding, Markdown fidelity, PDF navigation, PDF typography, Persian/RTL quality, Studio, and Visual QA to reduce guide/reference duplication and clarify ownership.
- Updated the docs index, documentation policy, README documentation map, and guide notes to make the new ownership model visible.

### Tests
- Added documentation-integrity coverage for the guide-first model and the maintainer-contract classification of focused docs.

## 1.13.23 - 2026-06-21

### Documentation
- Corrected the official advanced-code-fence samples so `{2,5-6}` visibly highlights three existing code rows instead of demonstrating an out-of-range range on a four-line snippet.
- Updated the Studio code insertion template and Markdown fidelity guide to use the same six-line sample, making line-highlight ranges easier to verify visually.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for visible multi-line highlight ranges and for documentation/Studio samples that keep `{2,5-6}` within the actual code block length.

## 1.13.22 - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- Removed the final highlighted-code indentation drift by eliminating the highlighted-line padding that shifted highlighted content one character to the right of the following indented code rows.
- Normalized highlighted-line CSS to inherit the code row's font size and line height so advanced numbered code blocks use the same vertical rhythm as ordinary code blocks.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage that highlighted numbered code strips preserve leading spaces, do not reintroduce the old padding offset, and keep the line break outside the `.hll` wrapper.

## 1.13.21 - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- Fixed the remaining advanced highlighted-code indentation defect by normalizing Pygments highlighted-line HTML so the newline is emitted outside the `.hll` wrapper. This keeps full-row highlight strips without letting the highlighted inline box consume the next line's leading spaces.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage that verifies the line after a highlighted numbered-code row keeps its leading indentation in the generated HTML.

## 1.13.20 - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- Corrected numbered-code gutter alignment for highlighted advanced code blocks by keeping Pygments line-number spans inline. The previous block display override doubled the effective gutter line spacing and made numbers drift away from code rows.
- Changed highlighted code rows from block boxes to full-width inline-block highlights so highlighted lines remain visually continuous without adding extra line breaks inside `<pre>` layout.

### Tests
- Added regression assertions that numbered-code gutter spans stay inline and highlighted rows use full-width inline-block styling.

## 1.13.19 - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- Aligned advanced numbered-code gutters with the actual code rows by moving numbered-code sizing and padding to shared per-style code metric tokens, then reusing those same metrics for both the code cell and the line-number gutter.
- Removed another source of numbered-code drift: the gutter no longer depends on hardcoded textbook/academic padding overrides inside the renderer, so future style tuning stays synchronized automatically.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage that every bundled style emits the shared code metric tokens and that numbered-code CSS uses those tokens for gutter/code alignment.

## 1.13.18 - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- Centered Mermaid edge-label text inside its rounded label chips more reliably for Chromium PDF output by switching chip text to an explicit `tspan` vertical offset instead of relying on SVG baseline heuristics alone.
- Removed the stray dark badge backgrounds that Pygments emits around numbered-code gutter spans so advanced code blocks render clean line numbers without per-line boxes.
- Added support for common pipe-labelled dotted Mermaid edges such as `-.->|no| Retry`, so practical guide diagrams keep the expected label and retry node in offline rendering.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for Mermaid chip text centering, pipe-labelled dotted Mermaid edges, and clean numbered-code gutter CSS overrides.

### Fixed
- Reworked highlighted code-line backgrounds so advanced fenced-code samples with line numbers stay readable on dark code surfaces in light styles and in dark-mode textbook/academic output, instead of resolving to pale callout-style or light-surface fills.
- Made mixed Persian/Latin table cells in Persian documents resolve to an explicit RTL base direction while keeping Latin identifiers isolated, fixing tables whose Persian descriptions were visually laid out as LTR.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for code highlight contrast CSS and Persian mixed-script table direction voting.

## 1.13.16 - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- Improved dark-mode palette tokens so low-saturation palettes such as `slate` and `neutral` keep readable TOC links, headings, and accents on dark textbook/academic surfaces.
- Marked code blocks containing Persian/Arabic script with stable CSS hooks and used Persian-capable font fallback inside those blocks so Persian YAML/string samples render joined and readable.
- Hardened `scripts/build_examples.sh` to render guide PDFs through the shared process-tree-safe command runner and force `--progress off` for non-interactive release builds.

### Tests
- Added coverage for dark-mode palette contrast tokens, RTL-script code-block CSS, and process-tree-safe guide example builds.

## 1.13.15 - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- Made the `MARDAS_RENDER_SMOKE=1` path in `scripts/check.sh` run the guide render through the process-tree-safe Visual QA command helper so CI/release smoke checks do not hang when Chromium descendants inherit captured output handles.
- Added `MARDAS_RENDER_SMOKE_TIMEOUT` for a bounded outer smoke-render timeout independent of the Chromium `MARDAS_TIMEOUT_MS` page timeout.
- Disabled third-party pytest plugin autoload inside `scripts/check.sh` by default, with `MARDAS_ALLOW_PYTEST_PLUGINS=1` as an explicit opt-in, so local release checks stay deterministic after Playwright smoke renders.

### Documentation
- Synced README badge and English/Persian guide metadata to version `1.13.15`.

### Tests
- Added release-script regression coverage for the process-tree-safe render-smoke wrapper.

## 1.13.14 - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- Replaced the heavyweight guide architecture SVG wrapper with an optimized document-local PNG so guide builds no longer embed a large base64 raster image inside SVG and then inside HTML.
- Updated English/Persian guide image and safe-HTML samples to use `images/architecture.png` while preserving the approved banner artwork.

### Documentation
- Clarified the guide media asset contract in `docs/BRANDING.md` and `docs/PDF-TYPOGRAPHY.md` so sample media stays lightweight and build-friendly.
- Synced README badge and English/Persian guide metadata to version `1.13.14`.

### Tests
- Updated guide media integrity tests to reject the removed nested-base64 `architecture.svg` path and enforce the optimized PNG contract.

## 1.13.13 - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- Switched the Studio topbar brand mark from the raster logo to a dedicated monochrome SVG mask so the GUI uses a true vector logo.
- Made the Studio brand mark inherit the exact same color as the `Mardas MD2PDF Studio` wordmark in both dark and light interface modes.

### Documentation
- Documented the new Studio-specific vector brand-mask asset in `docs/BRANDING.md`.
- Synced README badge and English/Persian guide metadata to version `1.13.13`.

### Tests
- Extended GUI, packaged-asset, and documentation-integrity tests to enforce the vector-branding contract for Studio.

## 1.13.12 - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- Replaced the guide-local architecture banner artwork with the supplied structured print pipeline illustration so the English and Persian manuals use the cleaner approved visual.
- Replaced the repository `README.png` hero artwork with the supplied dark banner so the public landing image matches the intended product presentation.
- Removed the obsolete `docs/guides/images/logo.svg` file from the guide media contract; the guide directory now keeps only the local `architecture.svg` sample and the approved `logo.png` copy.

### Documentation
- Documented the asset-layout policy for runtime packaged assets, guide-local documentation media, and the repository-level README artwork in `docs/BRANDING.md`.
- Synced README badge and English/Persian guide metadata to version `1.13.12`.

### Tests
- Updated documentation/media integrity tests so malformed guide-local `logo.svg` artwork cannot silently return and the replacement architecture banner contract stays explicit.

## 1.13.11 - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- Adopted the supplied Mardas MD2PDF application logo as canonical packaged full-color and white transparent PNG assets for Studio, cover branding, README artwork, and guide-local documentation assets.
- Centralized built-in product logo resolution and Studio brand-asset routing in `brand_assets.py` so renderer and GUI paths use the same asset contract.
- Refreshed the README hero image to use the dedicated application logo instead of the older generic mark artwork.

### Fixed
- Removed the legacy raster logo fallback from runtime branding and Studio asset routes so built-in branding no longer depends on the old Mardas logo file.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for canonical app-logo packaging, transparent PNG dimensions, Studio routing, renderer fallback order, and documentation references.

## 1.13.10 - 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- Replaced the chunked Visual QA runner's pipe-captured subprocess execution with the shared process-tree-safe command helper so batch audits report failed child chunks instead of hanging when Chromium or Poppler descendants inherit output handles.
- Aligned the guide media regression contract with the current architecture-banner samples: guide Markdown must use the document-local `images/architecture.svg` sample, keep the packaged `images/logo.svg` asset available, and avoid reintroducing direct logo embeds in the manuals.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for chunked Visual QA command capture and child-failure reporting.
- Updated guide media integrity coverage so contradictory `images/logo.svg` expectations cannot make the baseline test suite fail.

## 1.13.9 - 2026-06-20

- Added a dedicated white vector cover-label mark for built-in Mardas MD2PDF branding while keeping the full-color mark for Studio and document-local examples.
- Refined guide cover-brand mark sizing across packaged print styles so the logo remains centered in the compact label chip.
- Reworked the official guide architecture/banner SVG for cleaner spacing, alignment, and emerald visual consistency.
- Updated the English and Persian guide safe-HTML image sizing samples to reuse the architecture/banner asset instead of switching to the raw logo.
- Strengthened documentation integrity tests for the white cover-mark asset and the guide image-sample contract.

## 1.13.8 - 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- Fixed Persian checked task-list items so `[x]` markers still become disabled PDF checkboxes after mixed-script isolation wraps the Latin `x`.
- Rebalanced the official guide image samples so the standalone project mark remains compact and no longer forces a nearly blank Persian guide page.
- Updated the guide architecture diagram to use the official Mardas MD2PDF mark instead of the temporary literal `M` placeholder.

### Documentation
- Synced README badge and English/Persian guide metadata to version `1.13.8`.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for Persian checked task lists and the official guide logo sample sizing.

## 1.13.7 - 2026-06-20

### Changed
- Adopted the dedicated Mardas MD2PDF project logo as packaged SVG assets for the built-in cover brand label and Studio UI.
- Kept the legacy raster compatibility fallback while preferring `mardas-md2pdf-mark.svg` for new built-in product branding.

### Documentation
- Documented the official mark, app icon, guide-local logo copy, and custom-brand usage boundaries in the branding reference.
- Synced README badge and English/Persian guide metadata to version `1.13.7`.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for the packaged SVG logo asset contract and updated Studio logo checks for the new colored project mark.

## 1.13.6 - 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- Restored the product cover brand label to use the active appearance palette instead of a hard-coded blue product mark, so the official emerald guides keep the old compact label geometry while matching the current cover theme.
- Kept the guide cover brand label shadowless and compact, with the built-in Mardas product logo tinted through the surrounding palette-aware mark frame.

### Documentation
- Synced guide metadata, README badge, and changelog to version `1.13.6`.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage that rejects hard-coded blue product-brand styling and requires the modern emerald guide label to stay palette-aware and shadowless.

## 1.13.5 - 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- Restored the official guide cover label to the exact built-in product-branding path used by the earlier good guide examples: packaged Mardas logo, compact rounded pill, established two-line typography, and no drop shadow.
- Removed the temporary guide-local `images/brand-mark.svg` artwork from the official guides so the cover label no longer renders as a separate custom brand asset.
- Reintroduced product/custom brand classes only as stable render hooks so product labels can keep the classic Mardas styling while custom organization brands remain neutral.

### Documentation
- Clarified that official guides use `branding.mode: full` without custom `brand` metadata to preserve the built-in Mardas product label.

### Tests
- Updated regression coverage to require the official guides to avoid custom brand metadata and to keep the modern emerald cover label shadowless.

## 1.13.4 - 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- Restored the classic guide cover branding label: a compact rounded pill, circular optical logo frame, and the guide-local `images/brand-mark.svg` artwork used by the earlier official examples.
- Removed the product/custom cover-brand class split introduced in the previous branding polish so guide covers do not regress to a squared or overbuilt badge.

### Documentation
- Clarified that official guides intentionally pin the local brand mark to preserve the established guide cover identity.

### Tests
- Restored regression coverage that requires the official guide front matter to keep `brand.logo: images/brand-mark.svg`.

## 1.13.3 - 2026-06-20

### Changed
- Restored the official guide cover branding to use the packaged Mardas product logo instead of the temporary guide-local M-style placeholder mark.
- Refined the cover branding badge frame so product branding keeps the compact professional label while custom organization brands remain neutral and user-owned.
- Reworked the guide SVG brand samples and architecture diagram so they use a Mardas-like organic product mark rather than a literal `M` icon.

### Fixed
- Fixed the Persian guide pipeline code sample so the mixed RTL/LTR text no longer reorders visually inside the code block.

### Tests
- Updated regression coverage for guide branding metadata, packaged product logo usage, and the product/custom cover badge class contract.

## 1.13.2 - 2026-06-20

### Changed
- Strengthened the official guide visual identity so the English and Persian examples use a visibly emerald Mardas cover, callout, table, heading, and footer accent contract instead of only storing `palette: emerald` in front matter.
- Added a compact emerald guide brand mark and wired the official guides to use it for cover branding.
- Updated guide quickstart and automation examples to prefer the same `modern + emerald + light` appearance used by the official examples.

### Fixed
- Fixed remaining guide drift where the cover and semantic callouts still looked blue/violet/yellow despite the guide metadata declaring the emerald palette.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for the official guide brand mark, guide metadata, and modern-emerald callout/cover CSS contract.

## 1.13.1 - 2026-06-20

### Changed
- Reworked printed footer layout so the running metadata line stays truly centered while titles and page numbers align cleanly on the outer edges in both LTR and RTL guides.
- Standardized both official guides on the `modern + emerald + light` appearance so the documentation, Studio palette, and embedded brand artwork follow one consistent Mardas visual language.
- Refreshed the official guide SVG brand samples with a cleaner Mardas-style logo plate and a matching emerald architecture diagram.

### Fixed
- Fixed asymmetric Persian footer placement where page numbers and document titles no longer sat flush on the expected outer edges.
- Fixed English/Persian guide sample drift caused by using different styles and palettes across the official example PDFs.

### Documentation
- Synced guide metadata, release references, and appearance contracts to version `1.13.1`.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for footer slot alignment and the shared guide appearance contract.

## 1.13.0 - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- Reduced PDF preflight font warnings in modern/GitHub output by avoiding environment-specific Inter font embedding in print styles and guide SVG samples.
- Improved footer contrast in dark-mode PDF output so page labels and running metadata stay readable across styles.

### Added

- Added `scripts/check_pdf_preflight.py` for repeatable PDF font, rasterization, and parser-warning checks.
- Added `scripts/run_visual_qa_matrix.py` as a chunked full-matrix Visual QA runner for appearance and feature-heavy PDF audits.
- Added `scripts/release_gate.sh` to consolidate pytest, smoke rendering, guide rebuilds, PDF preflight, bounded Visual QA, and distribution builds into one release command.

### Documentation

- Documented guide-level PDF preflight checks, chunked Visual QA runs, and the consolidated release gate.

### Tests

- Added regression coverage for PDF preflight parsing, explicit appearance triples, chunking contracts, dark footer contrast, guide preflight documentation, and release-gate script wiring.

## 1.12.2 - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- Stabilized Visual QA subprocess handling so batch renders terminate full process groups on timeout instead of allowing orphaned Chromium or Poppler helpers to hang the matrix.
- Added explicit pdftoppm raster timeouts and clearer failure messages for PDF cases that create a file but do not exit cleanly.
- Polished Studio first-run state messaging so a missing local draft is treated as a clean ready state instead of an error.

### Added

- Added resumable and bounded Visual QA options: `--resume`, `--fail-fast`, `--max-cases`, and `--raster-timeout`.
- Added `--all-appearances` for feature-heavy PDF smoke audits so table, code, Mermaid, MathJax, callout, footnote, caption, and mixed-script coverage can be rendered across the full appearance matrix.
- Added `MARDAS_BUILD_NO_ISOLATION=1` support to `scripts/build_dist.sh` for offline or already-prepared release environments.

### Tests

- Added regression coverage for process-tree timeout handling, bounded all-appearance feature audits, reliable Visual QA CLI controls, Studio first-run status messaging, and the no-isolation build mode.
- Kept release metadata checks compatible with the supported Python 3.10 CI target by avoiding Python 3.11-only `tomllib` in the test suite.

## 1.12.1 - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- Normalized GitHub/Obsidian callout markers before Persian mixed-script isolation so raw markers such as `[!NOTE]`, `[!TIP]`, `[!IMPORTANT]`, and `[!WARNING]` never leak into rendered Persian PDFs.
- Preserved Persian-localized callout titles while still isolating Latin technical runs in the callout body.

### Tests

- Added regression coverage for Persian callouts in guides and mixed-script prose so future visual audits fail before raw callout markers reach generated PDFs.

## 1.12.0 - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Added Studio project files (`.mardas.json`) that preserve Markdown, export options, and attached asset data for repeatable local workspaces.
- Added a browser-side asset manager with append-only attachment handling, duplicate/limit checks, drag-and-drop support, per-asset removal, and one-click brand-logo assignment.
- Added accurate Studio preview mode and debug HTML export using the Python renderer HTML endpoint without starting Chromium.

### Added

- Added a Visual QA system for appearance matrix artifacts, feature-heavy PDF smoke artifacts, dependency-free PNG snapshot comparison, and Studio screenshots.
- Added CI artifact publishing for reduced visual QA outputs under `build/visual-qa/` so reviewers can inspect PDFs, PNG renders, manifests, galleries, and Studio screenshots without committing generated artifacts.

### Documentation

- Added `docs/VISUAL-QA.md` and linked it from the README and documentation index.
- Refreshed guide metadata and public version badges for version 1.11.0.

### Tests

## 1.10.0 - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Improved print-flow density for medium and long technical blocks so moderately large tables, code listings, and Mermaid diagrams consume less vertical space without clipping content.
- Added medium-size print-flow classes for code blocks and tables, allowing semi-large tables to split at row boundaries instead of moving as one sparse page block.

### Documentation

- Updated the PDF typography guide, public README badge, and guide metadata for version 1.10.0.
- Closed the Persian/RTL quality reference with a release-facing contract for mixed-script prose, generated labels, TOC layout, footnotes, captions, table audit hooks, and guide sample policy.
- Linked the Persian/RTL reference from the long-form documentation index.

### Tests

- Added regression coverage for medium code/table flow hints and the corresponding print-density CSS contracts.

## 1.9.9 - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Tuned Mermaid diagram contrast in dark mode so diagram panels, SVG backgrounds, node fills, labels, borders, and caption accents use a complete dark-surface variable contract instead of inheriting only generic panel colors.
- Brightened Mermaid strokes and label chips in dark appearance combinations, including low-accent palettes such as neutral and slate, without changing Mermaid parsing or supported syntax.

### Documentation

- Updated the Markdown fidelity reference and guide metadata for version 1.9.9.

### Tests

- Added regression coverage to ensure every dark style/palette combination emits the full Mermaid contrast variable set and that renderer CSS consumes those variables.

## 1.9.8 - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Isolated Latin technical runs inside Persian mixed-script prose so trailing ASCII punctuation such as `renderer.`, `GitHub Actions.`, and `PDF navigation?` stays attached to the Latin token during PDF rendering.
- Added print CSS for inline LTR isolation spans and external links inside RTL article content without rewriting author text or inline code.

### Documentation

- Updated the Persian/RTL quality reference and guide smoke metadata for version 1.9.8.

### Tests

- Added regression coverage for Persian mixed-script punctuation isolation and verified that inline code remains semantically unchanged.

## 1.9.7 - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- Restored the Persian printed table of contents to the compact English-like tree layout, keeping section numbers adjacent to titles instead of spreading them across the page.
- Mirrored nested TOC indentation inward from the RTL edge with start-side tree rules, while preserving heading IDs, visible TOC links, and PDF outline destinations.

### Documentation

- Updated the Persian/RTL documentation to describe compact RTL TOC tree behavior and guide smoke references for version 1.9.7.

### Notes

- Synced packaged release metadata and regression contracts with the documented 1.9.7 baseline after archive drift.

### Tests

## 1.9.6 - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- Added first-pass nested-list depth metadata and classes for Persian/RTL printed tables of contents so the hierarchy could be regression-tested without changing heading IDs, link targets, or PDF destinations.
- Introduced bidirectional TOC tree CSS hooks; the compact visual layout was refined in 1.9.7 after PDF review.

### Documentation

- Refreshed guide metadata and Persian/RTL smoke references for the 1.9.6 TOC tree hook pass.
- Expanded `docs/PERSIAN-RTL.md` with RTL TOC tree indentation concepts.

### Tests

## 1.9.5 - 2026-06-15

### Documentation

- Expanded the official English and Persian guides with compact Persian/RTL live smoke samples covering mixed-script prose, Persian and Latin numerals, semantic table captions, and reused footnote references.
- Clarified the documentation policy that guide files must stay readable user manuals while also serving as representative renderer test cases.
- Extended `docs/PERSIAN-RTL.md` with guide live-sample coverage rules for future Persian/RTL renderer changes.

### Tests

- Added documentation integrity checks that ensure the guides continue to exercise Persian/RTL tables, mixed numerals, captions, and repeated footnote references.

## 1.9.4 - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- Added table-level visual-audit metadata for Persian/RTL tables, including direction profile, number profile, cell direction counts, and numeric-cell counts.
- Added stable TOC item profile hooks so Persian, Latin, mixed-script, and numbered heading titles can be checked in generated HTML/PDF without changing heading anchors.
- Strengthened captioned table handling for Persian captions so RTL table captions, mixed numerals, and table wrappers expose deterministic audit classes.

### Documentation

- Expanded `docs/PERSIAN-RTL.md` with Persian table and TOC visual-audit guidance.

### Tests

- Added regression coverage for profiled Persian TOC items, table-level audit metadata, captioned Persian tables, and the related print CSS selectors.

### Fixed

- Completed the Phase 11 visual audit pass for Mermaid label extraction, guide media consistency, and RTL/LTR code isolation.
- Replaced stroked Mermaid edge-label halos with background label chips so PDF text extraction no longer duplicates edge-label glyphs.
- Ensured the public guide Markdown points to document-local SVG assets instead of blocked `README.png` placeholders.

## 1.8.7 - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- Polished the official guide PDF media audit by synchronizing the documented image snippets with the SVG assets rendered in the live samples.
- Fixed the architecture SVG heading so its leading text is not clipped in generated guide PDFs.
- Collapsed duplicated visible-TOC navigation notes in the English and Persian guides.

- Added regression coverage for long code/table print-flow classes and the injected print typography CSS.

## 1.8.1 - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- Rewrote visible PDF table-of-contents link annotations to explicit heading destinations so printed TOC entries keep working after pypdf metadata writes and cover/content merges.
- Kept PDF viewer outline/bookmarks and visible TOC links bound to the same real heading coordinates instead of relying on viewer-specific named-destination resolution.

### Tests

- Added regression coverage that verifies copied visible TOC link annotations are converted from named destinations to explicit PDF destination arrays.

- Aligned numbered code line gutters with code rows and switched highlighted code rows to the active palette accent surface.

### Added

- Added regression checks for palette-pure academic output, non-badge cover labels, and numbered code alignment CSS.

## 1.6.1 - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- Tuned dark appearance surfaces per style so `modern`, `github`, `textbook`, and `academic` keep distinct dark backgrounds instead of sharing one generic navy surface.
- Aligned dark cover pages with their content surfaces, including the nearly black `textbook` dark output.
- Tinted light cover decorations with the selected palette so palette changes are visible on the cover as well as content pages.

### Added

- Added an appearance matrix audit helper for rendering every `style × palette × mode` combination after visual-system changes.

## 1.6.0 - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- Replaced the older visual controls with one appearance model built from `--style`, `--palette`, and `--mode`.

- Restricted safe raw-HTML `data:` image URLs to common raster formats and rejected obfuscated URL control characters.
- Made Chromium sandbox mode configurable with `--chromium-sandbox auto|on|off`, keeping sandboxing on for normal users while preserving root/container compatibility.

### Documentation

- Added `SECURITY.md` and documented trusted input boundaries in the README and guides.

## 1.5.2 - 2026-06-10

### Fixed
